              I'm Chien-Chi, currently a graduate student majoring in Human-Computer Interaction in University of Maryland.
              With my undergraduate degree of computer science and math minor in Pennsylvania State University, I'm passionate 
              in UI/UX design, and delivering them into the world through my professional skills.

              Previously, as a software engineer intern, I designed and developed an application for internal employees in KCF 
              Technologies. Now, I am going to my next stage of life! With my graduate education, I aim to utilize knowledges in 
              Huamn-Computer Interaction along with my software skills and apply them into the industry.

              During 2019-2021, I was introduced to computer science field. I explored different fields 
              including data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, security, cybersecurity, 
              human-computer interaction, database systems, systems and networking, theory of computation...etc.

            >
              During 2021 to 2022, after some time exploring different fields, I decided to narrow my interests 
              of computer science fields down to human-computer interaction. I started to 
              do some researches and to be familiarized with necessary skills including HTML, CSS, React, PHP, C, OS, 
              Algorithms and data structure, and database management...etc.

              In Summer 2022, in addition to my internship, I utilized my skills and created personal projects including my portfolio, a room scheduler website, stock profit comparison simulation, and a simple e-commerce website.
              With the skills acquired, I also started to develop and design apps on IOS system.

              Having the experience, I decided to look for in depth concepts and knowledge in human-computer interaction field. 
              As a result, I went to Dr. Kenneth Huang and joined his CrowdAI Lab in Pennsylvania State University as a undergraduate researcher.
              Furthermore, I explored advanced online courses, and I am going to University of Maryland for graduate studies concentrating in human-computer interaction.
